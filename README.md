Hey, Thomas here! Welcome to the behind-the-scenes of the first Hack Club Hackathon for Club Leaders. It took place over the weekend of February 9th - 11th 2024 in San Francisco. 

The goal of this repository is to be a reference for the next person organizing a leader-focused hackathon. No hackathon is the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event.

### ‚ú® Inspiration behind Summit
I started my club a bit over a year ago. In some ways, leading a Hack Club felt like an island. I really loved leading my club, but I did not know anyone else who led a Hack Club. I felt a bit isolated. I led my club, and a bunch of other club leaders led their own clubs, but we were all separated by what felt like an ocean, until one day I saw a message from Dev! 
<img src="https://cloud-d1cu7e1qp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2024-02-15_at_12.39.38_pm.png" alt="epochMessage" style="max-height: 300px;">

My first reaction "wow this is amazing! I would love to go, but there's no way I can make this happen." I lived in South Carolina, and this event was being hosted in Delhi! I then went on a walk with my dog Bodhi, and I begin to think "hmm... maybe this is possible".  Hack Club offered flight stipends, and after some googling I found that if everything aligns perfectly, then I MIGHT be able to get my passport & visa in time. 

I decided to go for it. I somehow made it happen, and had the greatest adventure of my life! I met people who today I consider some of my closest friends: Sam, Nila, Fayd, Dev, Arpan, etc, built an awesome project, and got to experience a new part of the world! I came back to my club really excited with tons of new ideas for my club. 

For The Summit, I wanted to bake into the social contract that club leaders get to go on wild adventures like this. That idea led to this great experiment that you experienced as The Summit: 50 club leaders from around the world gathering to build projects with each other, become best friends, and explore a new part of the world (San Francisco).

### üìú The Call For Adventure
Dev & I had a meet at the cafe across the street from HQ. I wanted to make the invitation to club leaders feels incredibly special and valuable. He had the idea of scrolls, and he said he knew a guy who made scrolls in India. 

That idea spawned a bunch of design iterations until we landed on this design:
![Scrolls](https://cloud-6c2qm4k10-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0frontbackdesign.png)

We ordered hundreds of these and mailed them out to every club leader in the world! Club leaders quickly started sharing images of their scrolls in the slack:

Over 50 Club leaders from around the world came to The Summit! Check out the map below to see the different clubs that came to The Summit & see who they collaborated with:

We offered flight stipends to make it possible for these club leaders to come to San Francisco on this great adventure. We had $500 stipends for domestic, Canadian, and European flights (the cost of the flight was typically under $500, so the stipend almost always covered the whole cost of the flight), and we offered $1,000 stipends to those traveling internationally.

### ‚õµ Project Ships  
Projects ranged from r/place for clubs, a data visualization of the whole slack, a club inventory system to give members achievements for coming to meetings, an orpheus tomagochi home screen widget, a screaming fish that detects when the rooms gets too loud, and an app to help club members meet other members with similar interests.

Below is an opportunity for leaders to make a PR to this readMe and add in their ships!
### üé® Designers Behind The Scenes
Vivian, Acon, and I made most of the designs for The Summit!

#### Website
![Leaders Summit Site](https://cloud-qcgkae8nd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2024-02-15_at_2.18.27_pm.png)
I created the assets on this site using Dalle3, Figma, and [PngToSvg](https://www.pngtosvg.com).

[Website](https://summit.hackclub.com/) (Fayd wrote the code to implement the figma design)
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mqM6QHQXG3Y9VR7eLP2Hlc/Leaders-Summit-Site?type=design&node-id=200%3A34&mode=design&t=wSM7aAZ4iPPlfG85-1)

#### Hoodie
![Hoodie](https://cloud-je98eg8ld-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0hoodiedesign.png)
Vivian and Acon designed the hoodie! I helped a bit, but they get all the props for this design. 

We visited various print shops in SF and [Ivoine tried on all of the hoodies](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06ECPCR5EE/p1706052482386259). We went with the highest quality material. The logo on the front was embroidered. 

The material was by Independent Trading Company. We're quite satisfied with the quality of the hoodie material. The print shop messed up the print on the back for many hoodies leading to bleeding of the back design. 

#### Stickers
![stickers](https://cloud-rfxmxu758-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0coolstickers.png)
These were designed by club leaders in the [#sum-stickers slack channel](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06ELCK1D4L). Contributors include: Vivian, Acon, Savina, Mizuki, Hinson, and others!
#### Orpheus Summit Lofi

Here's a link to the [Summit Lofi Animation ](https://cloud-dejynxdzh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0202402062147__6_.mp4)

Vivian made this awesome Orpheus Summit Lofi Animation!
#### Summit Count Down
A few days before the summit, Dieter created a countdown. Originally, he thought about using stock footage from Pexels or some website online but realized that I had brought my old Sony handcam, and thought there was no better way to create a countdown besides filming the team and exploring the city. An hour of footage is like 100MB, which worked out perfect for creating an hour countdown! Check it out; it's unlisted on Hack Club's YouTube:

#### Badges
We made batches for every attendee and laser etched them into wood!
![Badges](https://cloud-lebw9049a-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2024-02-15_at_2.46.13_pm.png)

We had 15 different variants and used the variants to group people together for an ice breaker activity.
