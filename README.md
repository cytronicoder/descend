Leaders,

The echoes of something long forgotten stir beneath the surface. A melody, once powerful, has been lost deep within the shadows. It echoes the creativity and drive that brought you to this path. It calls out for... taro boba?

...

Nope, it definitely said your name. My bad.

You are invited to descend into the unknown—a world where your ideas and resolve will be tested. Legends speak of an ancient force, hidden in the depths, that has the power to reshape everything you know… if you can find it.

Prepare yourself. The gates will soon open, and the first note of the forgotten song will be revealed. Will you answer the call? Will you be the one to restore what has been lost?

Watch closely. Listen carefully. The melody begins soon.

_“Be strong, saith my heart; I am a soldier; I have seen worse sights than this.”_
